Zabbix Monitoring
Zabbix monitoring is utilized by select applications to oversee both application and database servers. Unlike Redgate, Zabbix does not require licensing fees, making it a cost-effective option for targeted monitoring needs.
## Updated Webpage Section: Integrating Zabbix Monitoring

Below is the modified section to seamlessly integrate Zabbix into your web dashboard.  
**Instructions:** You can add this as a new section titled "Zabbix Monitoring (E&I Applications)" after "Monitoring System Overview" or "System Comparison."  
The code and content are provided for inclusion in your HTML; supporting commentary is for clarity.

### 1. New Section for Zabbix

#### Placement Recommendation:
- **Best Placement:** After "Monitoring System Overview" and before "System Comparison"
- **Alternate:** Add as a third card in "System Comparison," or as a separate call-out panel.

#### Example HTML Content

```html

  
    Zabbix Monitoring (E&amp;I Applications)
    
      Overview of how engineering and infrastructure (E&amp;I) teams leverage Zabbix for database monitoring in application environments.
    
  
  
    
      80+
      Applications Rely on Zabbix
      Zabbix actively monitors the database hosts for over 80 engineering and infrastructure applications, providing real-time alerting on performance, health, and resource usage.
    
    
      Key Zabbix Features for Database Monitoring:
      
        Agentless and agent-based monitoring of database host metrics
        Custom triggers for CPU, RAM, disk, and database service health
        Centralized alerting dashboard and historical trend analysis
        Integration capabilities with E&I application alert workflows
        Email and other notification channel support
      
    
  

```

### 2. Dashboard Narrative Update

Add this sentence to your "Monitoring System Overview" or "System Comparison" sections:

> *Zabbix is utilized by E&I to monitor the database hosts of over 80 applications, ensuring proactive issue detection and robust infrastructure oversight alongside MNA and Redgate.*

### 3. (Optional) Zabbix in Comparison Table

If you'd like Zabbix to appear in the side-by-side "System Comparison," add as a third column:

| Feature                     | MNA               | Redgate           | Zabbix (E&I)                         |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Scope                       | Core health & availability | Performance metrics | Host-level metrics for 80+ applications |
| Alert Mechanism             | Automated incidents, multi-channel | Email only          | Centralized dashboard, email/other   |
| Severity/Triggers           | Warning, Critical | Low, Medium, High | Custom thresholds, dynamic triggers  |
| Users/Targets               | DBAs, Engineers   | DBAs, App teams   | E&I Application teams                |
| Integration                 | ServiceNow, SMS   | Manual ticket     | E&I workflow, email, dashboard       |


### 4. Navigation Update

Add a navigation link:

```html
Zabbix
```

### 5. Bullet Point for Home Section

In your summary cards/grid at the top, consider:

- **3 Monitoring Platforms:** MNA, Redgate, and Zabbix support complete DB infrastructure monitoring.

Using these additions, your interactive SPA dashboard will fully and accurately represent the Zabbix monitoring landscape for E&I applications. If you want the exact file version or further customization, let me know!
